# Usage notes

The typescriptreact.json file provides code snippets and triggers for the plugin [vscode-react-typescript](https://github.com/infeng/vscode-react-typescript/). To use the snippets, you need to install the plugin and copy the typescriptreact.json file contents into the typescriptreact.json in vscode.
